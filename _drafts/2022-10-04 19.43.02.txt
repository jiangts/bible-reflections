1. Romans 5:6-11
>“For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through Him.
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more,h aging been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have no received the reconciliation.”

Naturally I feel down when I sin, which results in hiding away from Him…
Instead, recognize that He loved me and died for me even when I was a zero. I was zero percent pleasing to Him, “living” totally in sin, dead and unresponsive to Him. So He won’t be down on me for this particular area of failure, or even rebellion. But He invites me to grow.
