> First Conversation: The first time I saw Brother Lawrence was upon
the 3rd of August, 1666. He told me that God had done him a singular
favor in his conversion at the age of eighteen. During that winter,
upon seeing a tree stripped of its leaves and considering that within a
little time the leaves would be renewed and after that the flowers and
fruit appear, Brother Lawrence received a high view of the Providence
and Power of God which has never since been effaced from his soul. This
view had perfectly set him loose from the world and kindled in him such
a love for God, that he could not tell whether it had increased in the
forty years that he had lived since.
>
> Brother Lawrence said he had been footman to M. Fieubert, the treasurer,
and that he was a great awkward fellow who broke everything. He finally
decided to enter a monastery thinking that he would there be made to
smart for his awkwardness and the faults he would commit, and so he would
sacrifice his life with its pleasures to God. But Brother Lawrence said
that God had surprised him because he met with nothing but satisfaction
in that state.
>
> Brother Lawrence related that we should establish ourselves in a sense
of God's Presence by continually conversing with Him. It was a shameful
thing to quit His conversation to think of trifles and fooleries. We
should feed and nourish our souls with high notions of God which would
yield us great joy in being devoted to Him.
>
> He said we ought to quicken and enliven our faith. It was lamentable we
had so little. Instead of taking faith for the rule of their conduct,
men amused themselves with trivial devotions which changed daily. He said
that faith was sufficient to bring us to a high degree of perfection. We
ought to give ourselves up to God with regard both to things temporal
and spiritual and seek our satisfaction only in the fulfilling of His
will. Whether God led us by suffering or by consolation all would be
equal to a soul truly resigned.
>
> He said we need fidelity in those disruptions in the ebb and flow of
prayer when God tries our love to Him. This was the time for a complete
act of resignation, whereof one act alone could greatly promote our
spiritual advancement.
>
> He said that as far as the miseries and sins he heard of daily in the
world, he was so far from wondering at them, that, on the contrary, he was
surprised there were not more considering the malice sinners were capable
of. For his part, he prayed for them. But knowing that God could remedy
the mischief they did when He pleased, he gave himself no further trouble.
> 
> Brother Lawrence said to arrive at such resignation as God requires, we
should carefully watch over all the passions that mingle in spiritual as
well as temporal things. God would give light concerning those passions
to those who truly desire to serve Him.
> 
> At the end of this first conversation Brother Lawrence said that if
my purpose for the visit was to sincerely discuss how to serve God,
I might come to him as often as I pleased and without any fear of being
troublesome. If this was not the case, then I ought visit him no more.
