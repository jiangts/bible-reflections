> *Inspired by the petitions and confidence of David in Psalm 119, as well as the acrostic form.*
> *Written in a day where my faith was stretched*



**A**ll Your words are true  
**B**ut only some take root in my soul

**C**hrist is here, right beside me  
**D**raw my eyes to You, Lord!

**E**very day there is a drought  
**F**ill my cup by Your Spirit

**G**od is Father, provider of all  
**H**ow could I look to another?

<br>

**I**n any moment, I can live or die  
**J**esus, be my rock and shield

**K**now the Lord, that He is good  
**L**est you trade bread for stone, or fish for snake

**M**ountains of doubt leave crumbs of faith, yet  
**N**othing is too wonderful for You, Lord

**O**verwhelmed and confused, lost and uneasy  
**P**resent your body, a living sacrifice to the Lord

<br>

**Q**uestions abound: "Why this weakness"?  
**R**eplies are quiet: "to know My strength"

**S**in overwhelms me, I cannot live well  
**T**rust Me completely, My salvation to tell

**U**nder any circumstance, will You hold me fast?  
**V**ery truly, my son: it was *through* the tomb that Jesus passed

**W**orship and praise, belong to Your name  
**X**ylophones to trumpets, Your grace to proclaim

<br>

**Y**ou are with me, every hour  
**Z**ero condemnation, and infinite power
