> *Reflection on Brian's class on the book of Ruth. I was out of town for most of the class, so I only made the last session.*
> *Here were some of my gleanings.*



Who was I,  
  that You would be my kinsman-redeemer?

I was not kin,  
  but a foreigner  
  hailing from an enemy nation.

What character had I before You?  
  Was there a pleasing fragrance in my name,  
  that you should declare,  
  "May I AM bless you?"

To whom had I shown hesed,  
  that I would be worthy to receive it?

<br>

But You spotted me in my desolate place.  
And You called out, with no hesitation.

I had no daring plan  
  to woo Your love  
But You,  
  You heeded the Father's daring plan  
  to woo mine.

You ran to me,  
leaving the riches of a palace  
	to walk where I walk,   
	to stay where I stay,   
	to make me a people,  
	to be my protector,  
	to die in my place

You bound the strong man,  
	and freed me from slavery.  
You spoke tenderly upon my heart  
	until I was gentled before You.

You refused my offer  
  to be a slave in Your house  
But You elevated me through marriage  
  that I should no longer call You my master,  
  but instead, my husband.

<br>

Jesus, thank You,  
	that I am Yours,  
and You are my kinsman redeemer.

Jesus, thank You,  
 	for sharing the pleasing fragrance of Your name,  
  and the blessings of I AM.

Jesus, thank You,  
 	that You have not stopped showing Your hesed  
 	all the days of my life  
 	and in me You are well pleased.

Jesus, thank You,  
  that though I am no Ruth,  
  Your **hesed** has the last word.
